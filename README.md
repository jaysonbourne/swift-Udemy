# swift-Udemy
This git-Repo is for documenting my learning process of Swift through the Udemy courses. It is also where I try and take the project-lessons and try to apply UI/UX ideology to them. So, hopefully the projects you will see will document a progressive improvement. If you have the time to add critique or even a resource you might think would be useful please feel free. I would appreciate the help and/or advice.

- As with all new projects I started with a simple **"Hello World"**
  * Mainly involved getting to know the different sections of Xcode.
  * It also introduced the Interface panel and the storyboard function

- The second project was aptly named **"Dicee"**
  * This one now combined functions, storyboard, and using the object library
  * It also introduced the motion method, so if shaken it would trigger an action.
	* I made sure to apply the use of constraints to make sure that the images wouldn't shift or distort if the size of the screen chagned

- The third project was a **Magic 8 Ball app**.
  * This was based on what I learned making the Dice app from before.
    * motion methods, functions, object library, constraints, UI image view
  * But this one allowed more of a freedom of creativity in how I wanted it too look.
